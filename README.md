# Imperial

Imperial is a fun game.

To run locally, enter the following into your terminal:

`bundle install`

`rake db:migrate`

In one terminal window: `rails s`

Keep `rails s` running and in another terminal window: `redis-server`

Running this locally depends on having bundler, postgres and redis installed.

I welcome contributions! If you're interested in submitting code or ideas, let me know.
